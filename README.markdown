Compass WordPress
==================

This Compass extension provides support for creating WordPress Themes and working with WordPress Theme Frameworks using Sass.

Installing
==========

Assuming you don't have Haml or Compass installed.

    sudo gem install gemcutter
    gem tumble
    sudo gem haml
    sudo gem install compass
    sudo gem install compass-wordpress

To install a theme into your existing compass project, add the following to your compass configuration file:

    require 'compass-wordpress'

OR, just run this command:

    compass -r compass-wordpress -f wordpress --sass-dir=sass --css-dir=css -s compressed -p <Theme Name> /path/to/installation

OR, run this command:

    compass create -r compass-wordpress --using wordpress <Theme Name>
		compass install wordpress/base --force <Theme Name>
		compass install wordpress/thematic --force <Theme Name>

What this does is call `compass`, requires the compass-wordpress extension, uses the framework wordpress, sets the sass and css directories, sets the Sass output to be compressed and finally ends with you setting the theme name.

** As of this version, we only have support for Thematic developed. Suggest one to use, or fork the project and take a stab at it yourself. Either way, get in touch we want to hear from you.

Note on Patches/Pull Requests
==============================
 
* Fork the project!
* Develop your feature or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is IMPORTANT so your work doesn't get broken in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version that's fine, but bump version in a commit by itself so it can be ignored when pulled)
* Send your pull request. Bonus points for usage of topic branches.
